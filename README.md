### Features and End User Interaction

The UofT Map allows the user to browse different buildings at the University as well as search for them in the search bar, either using the acronym or full name. It then displays the location on a map, which also displays all of the nearby study spaces such as libraries. The user will be able to view additional information about the study space, such as times open, which will be implemented in the backend. In the map, they can access features in the regular Google Maps interface such as street view. For more information about the app and documentation, they can navigate to the "about" page on the app.

The app targets people who would like to find a study space nearby their current building at the University of Toronto St. George campus. These are most likely students. They would either like to find a study space that they can go to quickly in order to save time searching, or would like to gather all of their options besides ones they already know, which is useful in certain situations such as when their regular study space is all out of room. 

The user would go to our app, and could quickly search their current location and immediately view a list of the nearby study spaces via a list. When they click on a particular location on the list, it shows up on the map, which they can use to determine different routes they could travel to get there.
